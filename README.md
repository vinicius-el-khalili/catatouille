Welcome to The Catatouille routine cousine!

In this project, I built a simple website that displays different categories of recipes.
The front-end was built with Next.js, while the back-end API is generated through Contentful, which is a headless CMS.
This project contains the following features:

- New recipes can be added, edited or removed from the database by the administrator (me) using the Contentful platform;
- All updates in the database are immediatly built and deployed into vercel;
- This app is responsive, as every app should be;


You can check the live demo here:

This project is based on a tutorial provided by NetNinja -> https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja .

Bon app√©tit!
